<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_1"></a>[1]</span></p>

<p class="p4">Over a century ago Washington laid
the corner stone of the Capitol in what
was then little more than a tract of
wooded wilderness here beside the Potomac.
We now find it necessary to provide
by great additional buildings for
the business of the Government. This
growth in the need for the housing of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
the Government is but a proof and example
of the way in which the nation has
grown and the sphere of action of the
National Government has grown. We
now administer the affairs of a nation in
which the extraordinary growth of population
has been outstripped by the growth
of wealth and the growth in complex
interests. The material problems that
face us to-day are not such as they were
in Washington’s time, but the underlying
facts of human nature are the same now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
as they were then. Under altered external
form we war with the same tendencies
toward evil that were evident in Washington’s
time, and are helped by the same
tendencies for good. It is about some of
these that I wish to say a word to-day.</p>
</div>

<p>In Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress you
may recall the description of the Man with
the Muck-rake, the man who could look
no way but downward, with the muck-rake
in his hand; who was offered a celestial
crown for his muck-rake, but who would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
neither look up nor regard the crown he
was offered, but continued to rake to himself
the filth of the floor.</p>

<p>In Pilgrim’s Progress the Man with
the Muck-rake is set forth as the example
of him whose vision is fixed on carnal
instead of on spiritual things. Yet he
also typifies the man who in this life consistently
refuses to see aught that is lofty,
and fixes his eyes with solemn intentness
only on that which is vile and debasing.
Now, it is very necessary that we should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
not flinch from seeing what is vile and
debasing. There is filth on the floor, and
it must be scraped up with the muck-rake;
and there are times and places where
this service is the most needed of all the
services that can be performed. But the
man who never does anything else, who
never thinks or speaks or writes, save of
his feats with the muck-rake, speedily
becomes, not a help to society, not an
incitement to good, but one of the most
potent forces for evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>There are, in the body politic, economic
and social, many and grave evils,
and there is urgent necessity for the sternest
war upon them. There should be
relentless exposure of and attack upon
every evil man, whether politician or business
man, every evil practice, whether in
politics, in business, or in social life. I
hail as a benefactor every writer or speaker,
every man who, on the platform, or in
book, magazine, or newspaper, with merciless
severity makes such attack, provided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
always that he in his turn remembers that
the attack is of use only if it is absolutely
truthful. The liar is no whit better than
the thief, and if his mendacity takes the
form of slander, he may be worse than
most thieves. It puts a premium upon
knavery untruthfully to attack an honest
man, or even with hysterical exaggeration
to assail a bad man with untruth. An
epidemic of indiscriminate assault upon
character does not good, but very great
harm. The soul of every scoundrel is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
gladdened whenever an honest man is
assailed, or even when a scoundrel is untruthfully
assailed.</p>

<p>Now, it is easy to twist out of shape
what I have just said, easy to affect to
misunderstand it, and, if it is slurred over
in repetition, not difficult really to misunderstand
it. Some persons are sincerely
incapable of understanding that to denounce
mud slinging does not mean the
indorsement of whitewashing; and both
the interested individuals who need whitewashing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
and those others who practice
mud slinging, like to encourage such confusion
of ideas. One of the chief counts
against those who make indiscriminate
assault upon men in business or men in
public life, is that they invite a reaction
which is sure to tell powerfully in favor of
the unscrupulous scoundrel who really
ought to be attacked, who ought to be exposed,
who ought, if possible, to be put
in the penitentiary. If Aristides is praised
overmuch as just, people get tired of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
hearing it; and overcensure of the unjust
finally and from similar reasons results in
their favor.</p>

<p>Any excess is almost sure to invite a
reaction; and, unfortunately, the reaction,
instead of taking the form of punishment
of those guilty of the excess, is very apt to
take the form either of punishment of the
unoffending or of giving immunity, and
even strength, to offenders. The effort to
make financial or political profit out of the
destruction of character can only result<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
in public calamity. Gross and reckless
assaults on character, whether on the
stump or in newspaper, magazine, or
book, create a morbid and vicious public
sentiment, and at the same time act as a
profound deterrent to able men of normal
sensitiveness and tend to prevent them
from entering the public service at any
price. As an instance in point, I may
mention that one serious difficulty encountered
in getting the right type of men to
dig the Panama Canal is the certainty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
that they will be exposed, both without,
and, I am sorry to say, sometimes within,
Congress, to utterly reckless assaults on
their character and capacity.</p>

<p>At the risk of repetition let me say
again that my plea is, not for immunity
to but for the most unsparing exposure of
the politician who betrays his trust, of the
big business men who makes or spends
his fortune in illegitimate or corrupt ways.
There should be a resolute effort to hunt
every such man out of the position he has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
disgraced. Expose the crime, and hunt
down the criminal; but remember that
even in the case of crime, if it is attacked
in sensational, lurid, and untruthful fashion,
the attack may do more damage to
the public mind than the crime itself. It
is because I feel that there should be no
rest in the endless war against the forces
of evil that I ask that the war be conducted
with sanity as well as with resolution.
The men with the muck-rakes are
often indispensable to the well-being of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
society; but only if they know when to
stop raking the muck, and to look upward
to the celestial crown above them, to the
crown of worthy endeavor. There are
beautiful things above and round about
them; and if they gradually grow to feel
that the whole world is nothing but muck,
their power of usefulness is gone. If the
whole picture is painted black there remains
no hue whereby to single out the
rascals for distinction from their fellows.
Such painting finally induces a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
moral color-blindness; and people affected
by it come to the conclusion that no man
is really black, and no man really white,
but they are all gray. In other words,
they neither believe in the truth of the
attack, nor in the honesty of the man
who is attacked; they grow as suspicious
of the accusation as of the offense; it
becomes well-nigh hopeless to stir them
either to wrath against wrongdoing or to
enthusiasm for what is right; and such a
mental attitude in the public gives hope<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
to every knave, and is the despair of
honest men.</p>

<p>To assail the great and admitted evils
of our political and industrial life with such
crude and sweeping generalizations as to
include decent men in the general condemnation
means the searing of the public
conscience. There results a general
attitude either of cynical belief in and indifference
to public corruption or else of a
distrustful inability to discriminate between
the good and the bad. Either attitude is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
fraught with untold damage to the country
as a whole. The fool who has not sense
to discriminate between what is good and
what is bad is well-nigh as dangerous
as the man who does discriminate and
yet chooses the bad. There is nothing
more distressing to every good patriot, to
every good American, than the hard, scoffing
spirit which treats the allegation of dishonesty
in a public man as a cause for
laughter. Such laughter is worse than
the crackling of thorns under a pot, for it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
denotes not merely the vacant mind, but
the heart in which high emotions have been
choked before they could grow to fruition.</p>

<p>There is any amount of good in the
world, and there never was a time when
loftier and more disinterested work for the
betterment of mankind was being done
than now. The forces that tend for evil
are great and terrible, but the forces of
truth and love and courage and honesty
and generosity and sympathy are also
stronger than ever before. It is a foolish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
and timid, no less than a wicked thing, to
blink the fact that the forces of evil are
strong, but it is even worse to fail to take
into account the strength of the forces that
tell for good. Hysterical sensationalism
is the very poorest weapon wherewith to
fight for lasting righteousness. The men
who with stern sobriety and truth assail
the many evils of our time, whether in the
public press, or in magazines, or in books,
are the leaders and allies of all engaged
in the work for social and political betterment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
But if they give good reason for
distrust of what they say, if they chill the
ardor of those who demand truth as a
primary virtue, they thereby betray the
good cause, and play into the hands of
the very men against whom they are nominally
at war.</p>

<p>In his Ecclesiastical Polity that fine
old Elizabethan divine, Bishop Hooker,
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He that goeth about to persuade a
multitude that they are not so well governed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
as they ought to be, shall never
want attentive and favorable hearers; because
they know the manifold defects
whereunto every kind of regimen is subject,
but the secret lets and difficulties,
which in public proceedings are innumerable
and inevitable, they have not ordinarily
the judgment to consider.”</p>
</div>

<p>This truth should be kept constantly
in mind by every free people desiring to
preserve the sanity and poise indispensable
to the permanent success of self-government.
Yet, on the other hand, it
is vital not to permit this spirit of sanity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
and self-command to degenerate into mere
mental stagnation. Bad though a state of
hysterical excitement is, and evil though
the results are which come from the violent
oscillations such excitement invariably
produces, yet a sodden acquiescence
in evil is even worse. At this moment
we are passing through a period of great
unrest—social, political, and industrial
unrest. It is of the utmost importance for
our future that this should prove to be not
the unrest of mere rebelliousness against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
life, of mere dissatisfaction with the inevitable
inequality of conditions, but the unrest
of a resolute and eager ambition to
secure the betterment of the individual
and the nation. So far as this movement
of agitation throughout the country takes
the form of a fierce discontent with evil,
of a determination to punish the authors
of evil, whether in industry or politics, the
feeling is to be heartily welcomed as a
sign of healthy life.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, it turns into a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
mere crusade of appetite against appetite,
of a contest between the brutal greed of
the “have-nots” and the brutal greed of
the “haves,” then it has no significance
for good, but only for evil. If it seeks
to establish a line of cleavage, not along
the line which divides good men from
bad, but along that other line, running
at right angles thereto, which divides
those who are well off from those who are
less well off, then it will be fraught with
immeasurable harm to the body politic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>We can no more and no less afford to
condone evil in the man of capital than
evil in the man of no capital. The wealthy
man who exults because there is a failure
of justice in the effort to bring some trust
magnate to an account for his misdeeds
is as bad as, and no worse than, the so-called
labor leader who clamorously strives
to excite a foul class feeling on behalf of
some other labor leader who is implicated
in murder. One attitude is as bad as the
other, and no worse; in each case the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
accused is entitled to exact justice; and in
neither case is there need of action by
others which can be construed into an
expression of sympathy for crime.</p>

<p>It is a prime necessity that if the
present unrest is to result in permanent
good the emotion shall be translated into
action, and that the action shall be marked
by honesty, sanity, and self-restraint.
There is mighty little good in a mere
spasm of reform. The reform that counts
is that which comes through steady, continuous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
growth; violent emotionalism
leads to exhaustion.</p>

<p>It is important to this people to grapple
with the problems connected with the
amassing of enormous fortunes, and the
use of those fortunes, both corporate and
individual, in business. We should discriminate
in the sharpest way between
fortunes well-won and fortunes ill-won;
between those gained as an incident to
performing great services to the community
as a whole, and those gained in evil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
fashion by keeping just within the limits of
mere law-honesty. Of course no amount
of charity in spending such fortunes in
any way compensates for misconduct in
making them. As a matter of personal
conviction, and without pretending to
discuss the details or formulate the system,
I feel that we shall ultimately have to consider
the adoption of some such scheme as
that of a progressive tax on all fortunes,
beyond a certain amount, either given in
life or devised or bequeathed upon death<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
to any individual—a tax so framed as to
put it out of the power of the owner of
one of these enormous fortunes to hand
on more than a certain amount to any one
individual; the tax, of course, to be imposed
by the National and not the State
government. Such taxation should, of
course, be aimed merely at the inheritance
or transmission in their entirety of
those fortunes swollen beyond all healthy
limits.</p>

<p>Again, the National Government must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
in some form exercise supervision over
corporations engaged in interstate business—and
all large corporations are engaged
in interstate business—whether by
license or otherwise, so as to permit us to
deal with the far-reaching evils of over-capitalization.
This year we are making
a beginning in the direction of serious
effort to settle some of these economic
problems by the railway-rate legislation.
Such legislation, if so framed, as I am
sure it will be, as to secure definite and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
tangible results, will amount to something
of itself; and it will amount to
a great deal more in so far as it is
taken as a first step in the direction of
a policy of superintendence and control
over corporate wealth engaged in interstate
commerce, this superintendence and
control not to be exercised in a spirit of
malevolence toward the men who have
created the wealth, but with the firm purpose
both to do justice to them and to see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
that they in their turn do justice to the
public at large.</p>

<p>The first requisite in the public servants
who are to deal in this shape with
corporations, whether as legislators or as
executives, is honesty. This honesty can
be no respecter of persons. There can be
no such thing as unilateral honesty. The
danger is not really from corrupt corporations;
it springs from the corruption itself,
whether exercised for or against corporations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>The eighth commandment reads,
“Thou shalt not steal.” It does not read,
“Thou shalt not steal from the rich man.”
It does not read, “Thou shalt not steal
from the poor man.” It reads simply
and plainly, “Thou shalt not steal.” No
good whatever will come from that
warped and mock morality which denounces
the misdeeds of men of wealth
and forgets the misdeeds practiced at their
expense; which denounces bribery, but
blinds itself to blackmail; which foams<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
with rage if a corporation secures favors
by improper methods, and merely leers
with hideous mirth if the corporation is
itself wronged. The only public servant
who can be trusted honestly to protect
the rights of the public against the misdeed
of a corporation is that public man
who will just as surely protect the corporation
itself from wrongful aggression.
If a public man is willing to yield to popular
clamor and do wrong to the men of
wealth or to rich corporations, it may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
set down as certain that if the opportunity
comes he will secretly and furtively do
wrong to the public in the interest of a
corporation.</p>

<p>But, in addition to honesty, we need
sanity. No honesty will make a public
man useful if that man is timid or foolish,
if he is a hot-headed zealot or an
impracticable visionary. As we strive
for reform we find that it is not at all
merely the case of a long uphill pull.
On the contrary, there is almost as much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
of breeching work as of collar work; to
depend only on traces means that there
will soon be a runaway and an upset.
The men of wealth who to-day are trying
to prevent the regulation and control of
their business in the interest of the public
by the proper Government authorities
will not succeed, in my judgment, in
checking the progress of the movement.
But if they did succeed they would find
that they had sown the wind and would
surely reap the whirlwind, for they would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
ultimately provoke the violent excesses
which accompany a reform coming by convulsion
instead of by steady and natural
growth.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the wild preachers
of unrest and discontent, the wild agitators
against the entire existing order, the
men who act crookedly, whether because
of sinister design or from mere puzzle-headedness,
the men who preach destruction
without proposing any substitute for
what they intend to destroy, or who propose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
a substitute which would be far
worse than the existing evils—all these
men are the most dangerous opponents
of real reform. If they get their way
they will lead the people into a deeper
pit than any into which they could fall
under the present system. If they fail
to get their way they will still do incalculable
harm by provoking the kind of
reaction, which in its revolt against the
senseless evil of their teaching, would
enthrone more securely than ever the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
very evils which their misguided followers
believe they are attacking.</p>

<p>More important than aught else is the
development of the broadest sympathy of
man for man. The welfare of the wage-worker,
the welfare of the tiller of the soil,
upon these depend the welfare of the entire
country; their good is not to be sought in
pulling down others; but their good must
be the prime object of all our statesmanship.</p>

<p>Materially we must strive to secure a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
broader economic opportunity for all men,
so that each shall have a better chance
to show the stuff of which he is made.
Spiritually and ethically we must strive to
bring about clean living and right thinking.
We appreciate that the things of the body
are important; but we appreciate also that
the things of the soul are immeasurably
more important. The foundation stone
of national life is, and ever must be, the
high individual character of the average
citizen.</p>
